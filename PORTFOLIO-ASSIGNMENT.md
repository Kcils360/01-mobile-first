# Portfolio Assignment for Class 1 - Mobile-First and Responsive Design

## Your professional online presence

In the coming weeks you'll be progressively building out a portfolio. There will be incremental goals to accomplish most class days in the coming three weeks, and those goals will be published in a PORTFOLIO-ASSIGNMENT.md doc in each of the lab repositories.

This project is intended to give you additional practice in the core topics of this course, including, but not limited to, responsive design, templating, AJAX and data management, and single page application development.

The portfolio site that you create will highlight your projects and interests, and showcase your skills to potential employers or clients. You will create a static portfolio site (no "backend server" code required) from scratch to represent your personal online presence. You may not have much content to populate the site with, so focus on laying a solid foundation that will allow the portfolio to grow as you complete more projects. Think about what kinds of information would be useful to display for each project (both for yourself and for prospective employers), then model your data and create your styling accordingly.

## Today's goals

We're going to start by making a paper wireframe of your portfolio. Refer to the wireframe samples in the adjacent `301-wireframes` directory for a guide. You can emulate these, or use them as a point of departure.

There are some required components for your portfolios:

- A nav bar featuring, at a minimum, selections for Home, Work, and Social content.
- An image carousel for the hero images.
- A list of completed code projects, such as your 201 projects, with details about those projects.
- Links to relevant professional online presence (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.) and any social media for which you wish to provide links.

## Git Flow

For each day's portfolio assignment, work on a new branch. When the work is completed, ACP that branch and make a PR to the master branch. Don't forget to pull your new remote master branch back into your local master branch!

## Submitting your work
- When you've completed the work for this assignment, merge your work to the master branch using a Pull Request on GitHub, and submit the link to your PR in canvas.
